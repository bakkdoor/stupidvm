stupidvm v0.1

stupidvm is a stupid virtual machine written in C.

Basically, I wanted to experiment a little with writing a small and
simple register-based virtual machine. It's licensed under the GNU
LGPL v3. Have a look at the LICENSE file for more information on
licensing terms.

Short introduction:
-------------------

If you want to try out stupidvm, check out the example programs in the
examples/ directory. You can compile & run them like this:

$ make
$ ./sasm examples/procedures.sasm procedures.svm
$ ./svm procedures.svm

This will compile both the compiler and the vm via make, compile one
example .sasm file (sasm stands for stupid asm) via svmc, the
svm compiler to a .svm binary bytecode file (svm stands for stupidvm)
and then run it via the svm executable.
