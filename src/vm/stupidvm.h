/**
   @brief Starts the main evaluation process of the vm.
   
   Basically, we start an infinite loop and run until we hit the HALT
   instruction, which stops the virtual machine. This means, that the
   programm itself is responsible for telling the VM when to
   stop. This might change in the future though, as I'm still unsure,
   if this is a good idea...
   We then check the opcode of each instruction within the loop and
   execute the appropriate code for that opcode. Pretty simple &
   stupid if you ask me ;)
